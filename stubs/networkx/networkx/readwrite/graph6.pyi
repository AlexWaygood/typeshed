"""Functions for reading and writing graphs in the *graph6* format.

The *graph6* file format is suitable for small graphs or large dense
graphs. For large sparse graphs, use the *sparse6* format.

For more information, see the `graph6`_ homepage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bytes_in : bytes
       Data in graph6 format

    Returns
    -------
    G : Graph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `bytes_in` is unable to be parsed in graph6 format

    ValueError
        If any character ``c`` in bytes_in does not satisfy

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.from_graph6_bytes(b"A_")

    [(0, 1)]

    Notes
    -----
    Per the graph6 spec, the header (e.g. ``b'>>graph6<<'``) must not be
    followed by a newline character.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph (undirected)

    nodes: list or iterable
       Nodes are labeled 0...n-1 in the order provided.  If None the ordering
       given by ``G.nodes()`` is used.
