Read graphs in GML format.

"GML, the Graph Modelling Language, is our proposal for a portable
file format for graphs. GML's key features are portability, simple
syntax, extensibility and flexibility. A GML file consists of a
hierarchical key-value lists. Graphs can be annotated with arbitrary
data structures. The idea for a common file format was born at the
GD'95; this proposal is the outcome of many discussions. GML is the
standard file format in the Graphlet graph editor system. It has been
overtaken and adapted by several other systems for drawing graphs."

GML files are stored using a 7-bit ASCII encoding with any extended
ASCII characters (iso8859-1) appearing as HTML character entities.
You will need to give some thought into how the exported data should
interact with different languages and even different Python versions.
Re-importing from gml is also a concern.

Without specifying a `stringizer`/`destringizer`, the code is capable of
writing `int`/`float`/`str`/`dict`/`list` data as required by the GML
specification.  For writing other data types, and for reading data other
than `str` you need to explicitly supply a `stringizer`/`destringizer`.

For additional documentation on the GML file format, please see the
`GML website <https://web.archive.org/web/20190207140002/http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/index.php?id=17297&L=1>`_.

Several example graphs in GML format may be found on Mark Newman's
`Network data page <http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/>`_.
