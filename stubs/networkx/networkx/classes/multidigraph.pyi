class MultiDiGraph(MultiGraph[_Node], DiGraph[_Node]):
    """A directed graph class that can store multiedges.

    Multiedges are multiple edges between two nodes.  Each edge
    can hold optional data or attributes.

    A MultiDiGraph holds directed edges.  Self loops are allowed.

    Nodes can be arbitrary (hashable) Python objects with optional
    key/value attributes. By convention `None` is not used as a node.

    Edges are represented as links between nodes with optional
    key/value attributes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    incoming_graph_data : input graph (optional, default: None)
        Data to initialize graph. If None (default) an empty
        graph is created.  The data can be any format that is supported
        by the to_networkx_graph() function, currently including edge list,
        dict of dicts, dict of lists, NetworkX graph, 2D NumPy array, SciPy
        sparse matrix, or PyGraphviz graph.

    multigraph_input : bool or None (default None)
        Note: Only used when `incoming_graph_data` is a dict.
        If True, `incoming_graph_data` is assumed to be a
        dict-of-dict-of-dict-of-dict structure keyed by
        node to neighbor to edge keys to edge data for multi-edges.
        A NetworkXError is raised if this is not the case.
        If False, :func:`to_networkx_graph` is used to try to determine
        the dict's graph data structure as either a dict-of-dict-of-dict
        keyed by node to neighbor to edge data, or a dict-of-iterable
        keyed by node to neighbors.
        If None, the treatment for True is tried, but if it fails,
        the treatment for False is tried.

    attr : keyword arguments, optional (default= no attributes)
        Attributes to add to graph as key=value pairs.

    Examples
    --------
    Create an empty graph structure (a "null graph") with no nodes and
    no edges.

    >>> G = nx.MultiDiGraph()

    G can be grown in several ways.

    **Nodes:**

    Add one node at a time:

    >>> G.add_node(1)

    Add the nodes from any container (a list, dict, set or
    even the lines from a file or the nodes from another graph).

    >>> G.add_nodes_from([2, 3])
    >>> G.add_nodes_from(range(100, 110))
    >>> H = nx.path_graph(10)
    >>> G.add_nodes_from(H)

    In addition to strings and integers any hashable Python object
    (except None) can represent a node, e.g. a customized node object,
    or even another Graph.

    >>> G.add_node(H)

    **Edges:**

    G can also be grown by adding edges.

    Add one edge,

    >>> key = G.add_edge(1, 2)

    a list of edges,

    >>> keys = G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3)])

    or a collection of edges,

    >>> keys = G.add_edges_from(H.edges)

    If some edges connect nodes not yet in the graph, the nodes
    are added automatically.  If an edge already exists, an additional
    edge is created and stored using a key to identify the edge.
    By default the key is the lowest unused integer.

    >>> keys = G.add_edges_from([(4, 5, dict(route=282)), (4, 5, dict(route=37))])
    >>> G[4]
    AdjacencyView({5: {0: {}, 1: {'route': 282}, 2: {'route': 37}}})

    **Attributes:**

    Each graph, node, and edge can hold key/value attribute pairs
    in an associated attribute dictionary (the keys must be hashable).
    By default these are empty, but can be added or changed using
    add_edge, add_node or direct manipulation of the attribute
    dictionaries named graph, node and edge respectively.

    >>> G = nx.MultiDiGraph(day="Friday")
    >>> G.graph
    {'day': 'Friday'}

    Add node attributes using add_node(), add_nodes_from() or G.nodes

    >>> G.add_node(1, time="5pm")
    >>> G.add_nodes_from([3], time="2pm")
    >>> G.nodes[1]
    {'time': '5pm'}
    >>> G.nodes[1]["room"] = 714
    >>> del G.nodes[1]["room"]  # remove attribute
    >>> list(G.nodes(data=True))
    [(1, {'time': '5pm'}), (3, {'time': '2pm'})]

    Add edge attributes using add_edge(), add_edges_from(), subscript
    notation, or G.edges.

    >>> key = G.add_edge(1, 2, weight=4.7)
    >>> keys = G.add_edges_from([(3, 4), (4, 5)], color="red")
    >>> keys = G.add_edges_from([(1, 2, {"color": "blue"}), (2, 3, {"weight": 8})])
    >>> G[1][2][0]["weight"] = 4.7
    >>> G.edges[1, 2, 0]["weight"] = 4

    Warning: we protect the graph data structure by making `G.edges[1,
    2, 0]` a read-only dict-like structure. However, you can assign to
    attributes in e.g. `G.edges[1, 2, 0]`. Thus, use 2 sets of brackets
    to add/change data attributes: `G.edges[1, 2, 0]['weight'] = 4`
    (for multigraphs the edge key is required: `MG.edges[u, v,
    key][name] = value`).

    **Shortcuts:**

    Many common graph features allow python syntax to speed reporting.

    >>> 1 in G  # check if node in graph
    True
    >>> [n for n in G if n < 3]  # iterate through nodes
    [1, 2]
    >>> len(G)  # number of nodes in graph
    5
    >>> G[1]  # adjacency dict-like view mapping neighbor -> edge key -> edge attributes
    AdjacencyView({2: {0: {'weight': 4}, 1: {'color': 'blue'}}})

    Often the best way to traverse all edges of a graph is via the neighbors.
    The neighbors are available as an adjacency-view `G.adj` object or via
    the method `G.adjacency()`.

    >>> for n, nbrsdict in G.adjacency():
    ...     for nbr, keydict in nbrsdict.items():
    ...         for key, eattr in keydict.items():
    ...             if "weight" in eattr:
    ...                 # Do something useful with the edges
    ...                 pass

    But the edges() method is often more convenient:

    >>> for u, v, keys, weight in G.edges(data="weight", keys=True):
    ...     if weight is not None:
    ...         # Do something useful with the edges
    ...         pass

    **Reporting:**

    Simple graph information is obtained using methods and object-attributes.
    Reporting usually provides views instead of containers to reduce memory
    usage. The views update as the graph is updated similarly to dict-views.
    The objects `nodes`, `edges` and `adj` provide access to data attributes
    via lookup (e.g. `nodes[n]`, `edges[u, v, k]`, `adj[u][v]`) and iteration
    (e.g. `nodes.items()`, `nodes.data('color')`,
    `nodes.data('color', default='blue')` and similarly for `edges`)
    Views exist for `nodes`, `edges`, `neighbors()`/`adj` and `degree`.

    For details on these and other miscellaneous methods, see below.

    **Subclasses (Advanced):**

    The MultiDiGraph class uses a dict-of-dict-of-dict-of-dict structure.
    The outer dict (node_dict) holds adjacency information keyed by node.
    The next dict (adjlist_dict) represents the adjacency information
    and holds edge_key dicts keyed by neighbor. The edge_key dict holds
    each edge_attr dict keyed by edge key. The inner dict
    (edge_attr_dict) represents the edge data and holds edge attribute
    values keyed by attribute names.

    Each of these four dicts in the dict-of-dict-of-dict-of-dict
    structure can be replaced by a user defined dict-like object.
    In general, the dict-like features should be maintained but
    extra features can be added. To replace one of the dicts create
    a new graph class by changing the class(!) variable holding the
    factory for that dict-like structure. The variable names are
    node_dict_factory, node_attr_dict_factory, adjlist_inner_dict_factory,
    adjlist_outer_dict_factory, edge_key_dict_factory, edge_attr_dict_factory
    and graph_attr_dict_factory.

    node_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the dict containing node
        attributes, keyed by node id.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object

    node_attr_dict_factory: function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the node attribute
        dict which holds attribute values keyed by attribute name.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object

    adjlist_outer_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the outer-most dict
        in the data structure that holds adjacency info keyed by node.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object.

    adjlist_inner_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the adjacency list
        dict which holds multiedge key dicts keyed by neighbor.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object.

    edge_key_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the edge key dict
        which holds edge data keyed by edge key.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object.

    edge_attr_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the edge attribute
        dict which holds attribute values keyed by attribute name.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object.

    graph_attr_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the graph attribute
        dict which holds attribute values keyed by attribute name.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object.

    Typically, if your extension doesn't impact the data structure all
    methods will inherited without issue except: `to_directed/to_undirected`.
    By default these methods create a DiGraph/Graph class and you probably
    want them to create your extension of a DiGraph/Graph. To facilitate
    this we define two class variables that you can set in your subclass.

    to_directed_class : callable, (default: DiGraph or MultiDiGraph)
        Class to create a new graph structure in the `to_directed` method.
        If `None`, a NetworkX class (DiGraph or MultiDiGraph) is used.

    to_undirected_class : callable, (default: Graph or MultiGraph)
        Class to create a new graph structure in the `to_undirected` method.
        If `None`, a NetworkX class (Graph or MultiGraph) is used.

    **Subclassing Example**

    Create a low memory graph class that effectively disallows edge
    attributes by using a single attribute dict for all edges.
    This reduces the memory used, but you lose edge attributes.

    >>> class ThinGraph(nx.Graph):
    ...     all_edge_dict = {"weight": 1}
    ...
    ...     def single_edge_dict(self):
    ...         return self.all_edge_dict
    ...
    ...     edge_attr_dict_factory = single_edge_dict
    >>> G = ThinGraph()
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 1)
    >>> G[2][1]
    {'weight': 1}
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 2)
    >>> G[2][1] is G[2][2]
    True

        This returns a "deepcopy" of the edge, node, and

        This is in contrast to the similar D=MultiDiGraph(G) which

        The copy method by default returns an independent shallow copy
        of the graph and attributes. That is, if an attribute is a
        container, that container is shared by the original an the copy.
        Use Python's `copy.deepcopy` for new containers.

        If `as_view` is True then a view is returned instead of a copy.

        Notes
        -----
        All copies reproduce the graph structure, but data attributes
        may be handled in different ways. There are four types of copies
        of a graph that people might want.

        Deepcopy -- A "deepcopy" copies the graph structure as well as
        all data attributes and any objects they might contain.
        The entire graph object is new so that changes in the copy
        do not affect the original object. (see Python's copy.deepcopy)

        Data Reference (Shallow) -- For a shallow copy the graph structure
        is copied but the edge, node and graph attribute dicts are
        references to those in the original graph. This saves
        time and memory but could cause confusion if you change an attribute
        in one graph and it changes the attribute in the other.
        NetworkX does not provide this level of shallow copy.

        Independent Shallow -- This copy creates new independent attribute
        dicts and then does a shallow copy of the attributes. That is, any
        attributes that are containers are shared between the new graph
        and the original. This is exactly what `dict.copy()` provides.
        You can obtain this style copy using:

            >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
            >>> H = G.copy()
            >>> H = G.copy(as_view=False)
            >>> H = nx.Graph(G)
            >>> H = G.__class__(G)

        Fresh Data -- For fresh data, the graph structure is copied while
        new empty data attribute dicts are created. The resulting graph
        is independent of the original and it has no edge, node or graph
        attributes. Fresh copies are not enabled. Instead use:

            >>> H = G.__class__()
            >>> H.add_nodes_from(G)
            >>> H.add_edges_from(G.edges)

        View -- Inspired by dict-views, graph-views act like read-only
        versions of the original graph, providing a copy of the original
        structure without requiring any memory for copying the information.

        See the Python copy module for more information on shallow
        and deep copies, https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html.

        Parameters
        ----------
        as_view : bool, optional (default=False)
            If True, the returned graph-view provides a read-only view
            of the original graph without actually copying any data.

        Returns
        -------
        G : Graph
            A copy of the graph.
