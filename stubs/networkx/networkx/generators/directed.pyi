    The GN graph is built by adding nodes one at a time with a link to one

    function of the degree of a node.

    The graph is always a (directed) tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes for the generated graph.
    kernel : function
        The attachment kernel.
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default DiGraph)
        Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Examples
    --------
    To create the undirected GN graph, use the :meth:`~DiGraph.to_directed`
    method::

    >>> D = nx.gn_graph(10)  # the GN graph
    >>> G = D.to_undirected()  # the undirected version

    To specify an attachment kernel, use the `kernel` keyword argument::

    A random `k`-out graph with uniform attachment is a multidigraph
    generated by the following algorithm. For each node *u*, choose
    `k` nodes *v* uniformly at random (with replacement). Add a
    directed edge joining *u* to *v*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes in the returned graph.

    k : int
        The out-degree of each node in the returned graph.

    self_loops : bool
        If True, self-loops are allowed when generating the graph.

    with_replacement : bool
        If True, neighbors are chosen with replacement and the

    -------

    .. versionchanged:: 3.5
       Different implementations will be used based on whether NumPy is
       available. See Notes for details.

    A random `k`-out graph with preferential attachment is a
    multidigraph generated by the following algorithm.

    1. Begin with an empty digraph, and initially set each node to have
       weight `alpha`.
    2. Choose a node `u` with out-degree less than `k` uniformly at
       random.
    3. Choose a node `v` from with probability proportional to its
       weight.
    4. Add a directed edge from `u` to `v`, and increase the weight
       of `v` by one.
    5. If each node has out-degree `k`, halt, otherwise repeat from
       step 2.

    For more information on this model of random graph, see [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes in the returned graph.

    k : int
        The out-degree of each node in the returned graph.

    alpha : float
        A positive :class:`float` representing the initial weight of
        each vertex. A higher number means that in step 3 above, nodes
        will be chosen more like a true uniformly random sample, and a
        lower number means that nodes are more likely to be chosen as
        their in-degree increases. If this parameter is not positive, a
        :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

    self_loops : bool
        If True, self-loops are allowed when generating the graph.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`~networkx.classes.MultiDiGraph`
        A `k`-out-regular multidigraph generated according to the above
        algorithm.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `alpha` is not positive.

    Notes
    -----
    The returned multidigraph may not be strongly connected, or even
    weakly connected.

    `random_k_out_graph` has two implementations: an array-based formulation that
    uses `numpy` (``_random_k_out_graph_numpy``), and a pure-Python
    implementation (``_random_k_out_graph_python``).
    The NumPy implementation is more performant, especially for large `n`, and is
    therefore used by default. If NumPy is not installed in the environment,
    then the pure Python implementation is executed.
    However, you can explicitly control which implementation is executed by directly
    calling the corresponding function::

        # Use numpy if available, else Python
        nx.random_k_out_graph(1000, 5, alpha=1)

        # Use the numpy-based implementation (raises ImportError if numpy not installed)
        nx.generators.directed._random_k_out_graph_numpy(1000, 5, alpha=1)

        # Use the Python-based implementation
        nx.generators.directed._random_k_out_graph_python(1000, 5, alpha=1)
