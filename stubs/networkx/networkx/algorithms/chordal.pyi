    A graph is chordal if every cycle of length at least 4 has a chord

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.

    Returns
    -------
    chordal : bool
      True if G is a chordal graph and False otherwise.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        The algorithm does not support DiGraph, MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> e = [
    ...     (1, 2),
    ...     (1, 3),
    ...     (2, 3),

    Notes
    -----
    The routine tries to go through every node following maximum cardinality
    search. It returns False when it finds that the separator for any node
    is not a clique.  Based on the algorithms in [1]_.

    Self loops are ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A chordal NetworkX graph
    s : node
        Source node to look for induced nodes
    t : node
        Destination node to look for induced nodes

        If the input graph is an instance of one of these classes, a

        The algorithm can only be applied to chordal graphs. If the input

    Examples
    --------

    Notes
    -----
    G must be a chordal graph and (s,t) an edge that is not in G.

    If a treewidth_bound is provided, the search for induced nodes will end
    as soon as the treewidth_bound is exceeded.

    The algorithm is inspired by Algorithm 4 in [1]_.
    A formal definition of induced node can also be found on that reference.

    """Return a copy of G completed to a chordal graph

    Adds edges to a copy of G to create a chordal graph. A graph G=(V,E) is
    called chordal if for each cycle with length bigger than 3, there exist
    two non-adjacent nodes connected by an edge (called a chord).

            The elimination ordering of nodes of G

    Notes
    -----
    There are different approaches to calculate the chordal
    enhancement of a graph. The algorithm used here is called
    MCS-M and gives at least minimal (local) triangulation of graph. Note
    that this triangulation is not necessarily a global minimum.
