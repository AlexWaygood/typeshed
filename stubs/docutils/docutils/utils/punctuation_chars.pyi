"""Docutils character category patterns.

Patterns for the implementation of the `inline markup recognition rules`_
in the reStructuredText parser `docutils.parsers.rst.states.py` based
on Unicode character categories.
The patterns are used inside ``[ ]`` in regular expressions.

Rule (5) requires determination of matching open/close pairs. However, the
pairing of open/close quotes is ambiguous due to  different typographic
conventions in different languages. The ``quote_pairs`` function tests
whether two characters form an open/close pair.

The patterns are generated by
``docutils/tools/dev/generate_punctuation_chars.py`` to  prevent dependence
on the Python version and avoid the time-consuming generation with every
Docutils run. See there for motives and implementation details.

The category of some characters changed with the development of the
Unicode standard. The current lists are generated with the help of the
"unicodedata" module of Python 2.7.13 (based on Unicode version 5.2.0).
