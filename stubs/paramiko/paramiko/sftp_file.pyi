        Ask the server for a hash of a section of this file.  This can be used
        to verify a successful upload or download, or for various rsync-like
        operations.

        The file is hashed from ``offset``, for ``length`` bytes.
        If ``length`` is 0, the remainder of the file is hashed.  Thus, if both
        ``offset`` and ``length`` are zero, the entire file is hashed.

        Normally, ``block_size`` will be 0 (the default), and this method will
        return a byte string representing the requested hash (for example, a
        string of length 16 for MD5, or 20 for SHA-1).  If a non-zero
        ``block_size`` is given, each chunk of the file (from ``offset`` to
        ``offset + length``) of ``block_size`` bytes is computed as a separate
        hash.  The hash results are all concatenated and returned as a single
        string.

        For example, ``check('sha1', 0, 1024, 512)`` will return a string of
        length 40.  The first 20 bytes will be the SHA-1 of the first 512 bytes
        of the file, and the last 20 bytes will be the SHA-1 of the next 512

        dramatically improve the download speed by avoiding roundtrip latency.
        The file's contents are incrementally buffered in a background thread.

        The prefetched data is stored in a buffer until read via the `.read`
        method.  Once data has been read, it's removed from the buffer.  The
        data may be read in a random order (using `.seek`); chunks of the

            <https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/pull/562>`_); as a
