Pyperclip

A cross-platform clipboard module for Python, with copy & paste functions for plain text.

Usage:
  import pyperclip
  pyperclip.copy('The text to be copied to the clipboard.')
  spam = pyperclip.paste()

  if not pyperclip.is_available():
    print("Copy functionality unavailable!")

On Windows, no additional modules are needed.
On Mac, the pyobjc module is used, falling back to the pbcopy and pbpaste cli
    commands. (These commands should come with OS X.).
On Linux, install xclip, xsel, or wl-clipboard (for "wayland" sessions) via package manager.
For example, in Debian:
    sudo apt-get install xclip
    sudo apt-get install xsel
    sudo apt-get install wl-clipboard

Otherwise on Linux, you will need the qtpy or PyQt5 modules installed.

This module does not work with PyGObject yet.

Cygwin is currently not supported.

Security Note: This module runs programs with these names:
    - which
    - pbcopy
    - pbpaste
    - xclip
    - xsel
    - wl-copy/wl-paste
    - klipper
    - qdbus
A malicious user could rename or add programs with these names, tricking
Pyperclip into running them with whatever permissions the Python process has.
