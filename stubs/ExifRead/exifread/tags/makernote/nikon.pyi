    First digit seems to be in steps of 1/6 EV.
    Does the third value mean the step size?  It is usually 6,
    but it is 12 for the ExposureDifference.
    Check for an error condition that could cause a crash.
    This only happens if something has gone really wrong in
    reading the Nikon MakerNote.
